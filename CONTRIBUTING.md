# Contributing to Pipeline Bootstrap

Contributions are welcome. Please use the standard
[Fork and Pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) workflow. Note that your pull
request will not be against `master` .

## Before you start

We ask that you read our **CODE OF CONDUCT** before you do anything else.

Proposed changes should have an issue raised doing any work. Bugs should go straight to
[our issues](https://github.com/BorderTech/pipeline-bootstap/issues).

## Mandatory requirements

We will not pull any changes unless these requirements are met.

-   Your change must be covered by unit tests.
-   The [CI build](https://travis-ci.com/BorderTech/pipeline-bootstap) must pass.
-   Front-end code must be [accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

## Changelog

In general changes will require a CHANGELOG entry (there will be exceptions, for example if you are
reverting a previous change that had not yet been released) and be sure to reference the issue
number that the change addresses.
